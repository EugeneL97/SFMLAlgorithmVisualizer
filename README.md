# SFML Algorithm Visualizer

The goal is to create an interactive and educational tool that allows users to explore different algorithms visually. I’m starting with sorting algorithms and eventually plan to add pathfinding algorithms. 

## Why This Project?

I wanted to challenge myself by combining my C++ skills with SFML while creating something tangible and educational. This visualizer helps me understand algorithms better by seeing them in action, and I hope it can help others too.

## Current Features

- **Sorting Visualization:** Watch how various sorting algorithms operate step by step.
- **Interactive Controls:** Play, pause, and eventually go back to the menu to pick another algorithm.
- **Clean and Readable Code:** I prioritize readability to make it easier to understand and maintain.

## What’s Next?

I’m planning to:
- Add the commonly used sorting algorithms as well as the ones we learn in school.
- Integrate pathfinding algorithms to expand the visualizer’s scope
- Experiment with new UI/UX ideas to allow for more flexibility and practicality from the user's perspective

## Getting Started

You’ll need to have SFML installed on your system. Once that’s set up, just clone this repo and run the following:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./SFMLAlgorithmVisualizer
```

## Why SFML?

I chose SFML because of its straightforward implementation and learning curve. It lets me focus on implementing algorithms without being overly concerned by the extra boilerplate code of lower level graphics engines. Eventually I'd like to give this a go in OpenGL!

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for implementation, I'd love to hear them!
